This Repo contains the excercisees one must do to go through the odin project

### Learning with The Odin Project

The Odin Project is a free and open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development. It provides a clear, structured path from the basics to advanced topics, making it ideal for beginners and self-taught developers.

Currently working through the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations), which covers essential topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. The lessons are project-based, helping reinforce practical skills through real examples.

The platform also offers two main paths:
- [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)
- [Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails)

An active [Discord community](https://discord.gg/fbFCkYabZB) is available for support, collaboration, and networking throughout the learning journey.

Highly recommended for anyone serious about becoming a web developer.


### Note
Some parts of this repo were merged and put together using a script I created, Initially they were in their own repositories in my github but they were small projects and very basc stuff so i decided to clean up my github and merge them all together, this process makes the commits unavailable for the merged repos so I have a local backp from VSCODE linked below for documentation purposes. Excerciss don after the merge proces should have their relevant commit hashes and file strcutures. 

This step was taken to make the repo more structured and cleaner each excercise will be on its own foder named according to the excercise name as seen on TOP
