Hey Stalker,

This is done as an assignment project to the odin project:
    the goal is to create a simple webpage with HTML5
    no styling will be done now but CSS styling may be added later if required by TOP.

If you're reading this I hope you have a wonderfull day and goodluck.

I hope this project leads me to a journey of many years of coding :)
